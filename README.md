Throughout my CS-320 course, the projects I undertook were pivotal in honing my expertise in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. The Contact Management System project was a cornerstone, where I crafted Contact.java and ContactService.java, coupled with their unit tests, ContactTest.java and ContactServiceTest.java. These artifacts underscored my commitment to developing secure, maintainable, and functional software. The Summary and Reflections Report furthered this narrative by dissecting the challenges faced, the methodologies employed to surmount them, and the vital role of user-centric design. My design strategy is deeply rooted in understanding user needs, leveraging design patterns, and adhering to best practices to engineer scalable, efficient, and maintainable software solutions. This suite of projects not only reflects my technical acumen but also my dedication to quality and the principles of user-focused software development.
